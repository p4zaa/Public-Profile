<p align="justify">
The objective of this senior project was to develop a social recommendation method based on weighted graphs, combining user influence graph and user interest graph. The project was conducted over a period of one year, with the guidance and advice of an expert advisor in the field of machine learning and deep learning. <br/>
</p>

<p align="justify">
The social recommendation method was evaluated using Hit Ratio and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain metrics on the Yelp open dataset, which consisted of a minimum of 5,000 users and 40,000 items. The results showed that the social recommendation method based on weighted graphs improved the effectiveness compared to the “A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social Recommendation” (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00844' >DiffNet++</a>) method. <br/>
</p>

<p align="justify">
As the sole participant in this project, I took on a range of responsibilities, from researching relevant research papers to data preparation and model development. With the support of my advisor, I modified the DiffNet++ source code to be compatible with the latest versions of Python and TensorFlow libraries, as well as preprocessed the data. My key contributions included proposing a weighted graph as part of the social recommendation method and improving the performance of the baseline model. <br/>

|**Non-Weighted Graph**<br/>(Baseline method)|**Weighted Graph**<br/>(Proposed method)|

#### Graph-Based Model Advantages:
  - Graph can handle large amounts of data.
  - Graphs can represent complex relationships between entities clearly and intuitively.
  - My proposed weight calculation can provide a meaningful perspective in the graph-based model.

#### Comparison between baseline model and weighted graph model on Yelp dataset.

#### Tables illustrated the evaluation scores on HitRate (top) and NDCG (lower) in each test round.

| <img align="center" src="img/results/Picture7.png" width="100%"/> | <img align="center" src="img/results/Picture8.png" width="100%"/> |

#### Result:
  - The average scores in HitRate and NDCG metrics indicate that the proposed model (DiffNet++ with weighted graph) performed better than the baseline model, but the improvement was not significant.
  
<p align='justify'>
Although my proposed model showed promising results, it did not outperform the baseline model as expected. Further improvements and optimization are needed to achieve better performance. This project demonstrates my expertise in graph neural networks, deep learning, and recommendation systems, as well as my ability to work independently and lead a research project from start to finish.
