**Keywords:** `Social Recommendation` `Graph Neural Network` <br/>
**Tools/Frameworks:** `Python` `TensorFlow` `Pandas` <br/>
**Dataset:** [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) <br/>

<p align="justify">
The objective of this senior project was to develop a social recommendation method based on weighted graphs, combining user influence graph and user interest graph. The project was conducted over a period of one year, with the guidance and advice of an expert advisor in the field of machine learning and deep learning. <br/>
</p>

<p align="justify">
The social recommendation method was evaluated using Hit Ratio and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain metrics on the Yelp open dataset, which consisted of a minimum of 5,000 users and 40,000 items. The results showed that the social recommendation method based on weighted graphs improved the effectiveness compared to the “A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social Recommendation” (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00844' >DiffNet++</a>) method. <br/>
</p>

<p align="justify">
As the sole participant in this project, I took on a range of responsibilities, from researching relevant research papers to data preparation and model development. With the support of my advisor, I modified the DiffNet++ source code to be compatible with the latest versions of Python and TensorFlow libraries, as well as preprocessed the data. My key contributions included proposing a weighted graph as part of the social recommendation method and improving the performance of the baseline model. <br/>
